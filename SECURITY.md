## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Collect information
To report a vulnerability, please prepare and collect the following information. We do not expect you to give 100% answers but we depend on contextual information to evaluate your report.

* Did you track down the cause of the vulnerability? If so, is it caused by a plugin or the framework?
* What type of vulnerability do you want to report? (You can use the CWE for this, if you know how to use the database.) Here are some examples for you:  
  * Exposure of information  
  * Manipulation of data  
  * Service disruption  
  * Remote code execution  
  * Griefing/Trolling (causing annoyance to users without actual service disruption)
* Through which channel can this vulnerability be exploited?
  * [A] Malicious input from TeamSpeak.
  * [B] Malicious input via. HTTP.
  * [C] Installation of a malicious plugin.
  * [D] Malicious configuration.
  * [E] Misconfiguration. (Not to be confused with the above, which would be with intention.)
* How did you find this vulnerability? (Yes, we want to know the story :) )
* Have you seen this vulnerability being exploited in the wild?
* How critical would you rate this vulnerability (and why)?
  
__Can I expect support for the vulnerability found?__  
It depends.  
For example, we provide support for the exploitation channels A, B and E. We ~will~ can only provide limited support for C and D for severe risk vulnerabilities.  
If you aren't sure, don't hesitate to contact us.  

### Sending your report  
_Please do __not__ publicly disclose vulnerabilities! This will unnecessarily put users at risk._  

The best channel for vulnerability reports would be mailing us at ``technik@fearnixx.de`` (we speak English and German).  
If you don't hear from us in a few days, please reach out to our head developer on Twitter:

### Justification of response times  
We want to you to know that our response times are usually fast (a few hours) but may also include a few days of waiting. We're a group of voluntary 
tech enthusiasts and at times we may not have the capacity to deal with message requests on short notice.
