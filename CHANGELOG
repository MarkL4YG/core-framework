~ Some JSON-parsing fixes in the HTTP functionality
~ Fixed a few bugs where the HTTP-Server ignored several headers for reverse-proxy setups
~ ``TypedCommandService`` is now enabled by default
~ Provided a work-around for server administrators who are unaware of their virtualserver id (``use``-command is performed with the ``-voice`` flag)
~ Reworked internal channel sorting which should now be more consistent
~ Fixed lazy permission lookups not working (when ``permlist`` command is not allowed)
~ Implemented parallel dispatching of ``IAnswer`` events to prevent lockups in internal requests
~ Optimized log-levels of ``DBUserService`` for less log spam
~ Fixed a bug where in some cases the ``Disconnect`` event wasn't fired causing the framework not to attempt a reconnect

~ General dependency updates

## 1.1.0 (Typed commands, Language selection)
+ Added a new command service that allows for declarative commands and typed parameters
