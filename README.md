# JeakBot TeamSpeak 3 Plugin Framework  

## TS3 Servers on the next level!

The JeakBot-Framework connects to the TeamSpeak server using the _TS3 server query interface_.  
Java plugins can use the API to interact with the TeamSpeak server using the JeakBot-API.  
Plugins can be programmed in a way that developers may be familiar from [the Sponge plugin API for Minecraft](https://spongepowered.org) as the projects idea is inspired by Sponge.

[1]: [CVE-2018-10237](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10237) has been ignored as we do not use Guava for data deserialization. The vulnerability is introduced by org.reflections which we use for classpath scanning. (The attack vector is over the network where Reflections and thus Guava is not used.)
