# JeakBot TeamSpeak 3 Plugin Framework  

## TS3 Servers on the next level!

The JeakBot-Framework connects to the TeamSpeak server using the _TS3 server query interface_.  
Java plugins can use the API to interact with the TeamSpeak server using the JeakBot-API.  
Plugins can be programmed in a way that developers may be familiar from [the Sponge plugin API for Minecraft](https://spongepowered.org) as the projects idea is inspired by Sponge.

> [1]: [CVE-2018-10237](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-10237) has been ignored as we do not use Guava for data deserialization. The vulnerability is introduced by org.reflections which we use for classpath scanning. (The attack vector is over the network where Reflections and thus Guava is not used.) __The reflections update for this CVE seems to be incompatible at the moment and needs to be investigated at some point.__  
> [2]: [CVE-2019-12814](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12814) has been ignored: This vulnerability is specific to the library jdom:jdom being present on the runtime class path. This is not the case for our project. Our project is not vulnerable by default unless administrators knowingly change the runtime environment which is not our responsibility.  
  
_Note: Although we ignore vulnerabilities that do not apply to our distribution environment, we will apply patches when possible just to adress concerns and deviated environments._
