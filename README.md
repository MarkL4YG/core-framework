# JeakBot TeamSpeak 3 Plugin Framework  
## TS3 Servers on the next level!

The JeakBot-Framework connects to the TeamSpeak server using the _TS3 server query interface_.  
Java plugins can use the API to interact with the TeamSpeak server using the JeakBot-API.  
Plugins can be programmed in a way that developers may be familiar from [the Sponge plugin API for Minecraft](https://spongepowered.org) as the projects idea is inspired by Sponge.
